# To-Do-List-Website
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple to do list website. 

## Project Overview
Here is how the website looks like:
![To Do Website Landing Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1316bf6-5942-4bc9-8a08-fe6eb2cdff7c)


The UI elements for the input box and checkbox were found from [Uiverse](https://uiverse.io/). These elements were slightly modified to match the look I wanted to create.
* Input box: https://uiverse.io/adamgiebl/ordinary-impala-4
* Checkbox: https://uiverse.io/Galahhad/sweet-ape-100

User Functionality:
* To create a task, type into the input box and press enter 
* To check off a task, click the task's checkbox
* To edit a task, click on the task's text
* To delete a task, click the X button
